.. function:: split_trajectories(trajectories: List[Tuple], subsequence_length: int)

   Helper for splitting a list of trajectories into a list of overlapping
   subsequences.

   For each trajectory, assuming a subsequence length of 10, this function
   includes in its output overlapping subsequences corresponding to
   timesteps...

   :param trajectories: list of trajectories, where each is a tuple of
                        ``(states, observations, controls)``. Each tuple member should be
                        either a numpy array or dict of numpy arrays with shape ``(T, ...)``.
   :type trajectories: list
   :param subsequence_length: # of timesteps per subsequence.
   :type subsequence_length: int

   :returns: *list* -- A list of subsequences, as ``(states, observations, controls)``
             tuples. Each tuple member should be either a numpy array or dict of
             numpy arrays with shape ``(subsequence_length, ...)``.
